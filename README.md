# Capstone Project HTML and CSS

This project is the capstone project of the Microverse curriculum HTML and CSS3 section.
The website is about the national robotic competition, a place where passionate people meet, learn, and compete with each other. The website contains 3 pages, main page where I introduced the competition, the about page where I presented the competition and some previous sessions, finally the tickets page to reserve your place, all the pages are responsive (breakpoint 768px) and the design is inspired from [Cindy Shin in Behance](https://www.behance.net/adagio07).
